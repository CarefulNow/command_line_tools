# command_line_tools
For some redesigned (mainly to include colour output!!) command line tools 

## rfind
This is an implementation of find that will use regex as standard to search the filesystem for matches. This (currently) will match a file or directory. All matches are outputted in green. When the verbose option is turned on, it will show all non matches in red as well.
